    "Proof of correctness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Claim 1: If line 4 is executed more than once, than $upper - lower$ at the $i$th time line 4 is executed is less than $upper - lower$ at the $(i-1)$th time line 4 is executed for $i > 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: By line 5 we know that $lower \\leq mid \\leq upper$ is always true. Then the execution of line 9 will strictly decrease the value of $upper$, and the execution of line 11 will strictly increase the value of $lower$. Since line 9 and line 11 are the only two lines that can jump back to line 4, the claim is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "Claim 2: When line 4 is executed, either $upper \\geq lower$ or $V$ is not in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: Proof by induction. Base case: when line 4 is reached for the first time, $lower$ and $upper$ are initialized by line 2 and line 3. The statement is trivially true. Inductive step: when line 4 is reached for the $i$th time, $i>1$, either $A[mid] = V$ or $A[mid] \\neq V$. If $A[mid] = V$, there will not be another execution of the loop, and the function returns $mid.$ If $A[mid] \\neq V$, by the inductive hypothesis, $lower \\leq upper$. If $lower < upper$, after $upper$ is updated by line 9 or $lower$ is updated by line 11, $lower \\leq upper$ still holds. After the bound update, because the array is sorted, $V$ must have an index in the $[lower, upper]$ range if it is in $A$. If $lower = upper$, $lower = upper = mid$. Then after $upper$ is updated by line 9 or $lower$ is updated by line 11,  $lower \\leq upper$ no longer holds. In this case, the range is an empty set, so $V$ is not in $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because line 12 is only reachable when $lower > upper$, so -1 is only returned when $V$ is not in $A$ by Claim 2. By Claim 1, the loop cannot be executed infinitely many times. So it will terminate and return $mid$ when it finds a $mid$ such that $A[mid] = V$ if $V$ is in $A$ or return -1 at line 12. Thus the postcondition of the function holds. \\qedsymbol"
